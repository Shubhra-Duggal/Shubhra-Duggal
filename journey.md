# JOURNEY

* Prepared for IIT Advanced, but it became a missed opportunity
* Started developing business acumen, to be able to market my skills.
* I had partial success as I went to Benguluru to attend UCB microaccelerator program for my startup idea.
* I was appreciated as a good speaker and strong character, but with limited knowledge and exposure
* Had to pivot focus because the experience made me realise that I only knew enough to make a couple of bucks, not go out there and make an actual difference 
* Started working on technical subjects; loved learning about computer networking and security; operating systems not so much
* Always loved reading books; got recommended a book 'Silence and Storm' by 'Rob Their' on wattpad
* Read the first part, wanted to buy the hard copy but it was too costly as there were 7 books of around 1500/- each, that would make it 10,500/-.
* It was historical fiction, setting was in London and ran parallel to the time India was colonised
* I used to read about the events mentioned in the book on the Internet.
* Became passionate about knowing what happened then, and about the situaton know.
* At the same time, my parents wanted me to try for Civil Services, because they saw potential
* I was reluctant because this entire buzz about IAS and UPSC was around too much and a part of me felt like it was just elitism and blown out of proportion.
* Shift in career aspirations happened in 2020, during the pandemic, when everything was on lockdown.
* My mother was still on my case, because I was at a crucial stage to start preparation, 3rd year in college.
* On her insistence, I went through the syllabus and exam pattern and questions.
* My reaction in that order was: Shock, Astonishment, Happiness and Headache
* Headache, because it was A LOT. Goodness!
* I resonated with the syllabus to be honest,except for economics, never paid much attention to that, so I started with that. It was slow, but I did it.
* I had read about IAS and IFS. About the choice I had to make.
* I chose IFS because I would have been able to make a better contribution there owing to the fact I am young, unmarried, can make a conversation in english and would not have difficulty in becoming fluent in French
* It came as a shock to me when I learnt that I can not transfer to IAS after serving for IFS; I don't understand the reason but I accepted it as such.
